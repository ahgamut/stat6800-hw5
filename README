the subfolders in this directory contain the necessary code required to
to run the bootstrap hypothesis tests for Questions 5 and 6 of STAT6800
HW5 2024.

FOLDER STRUCTURE
----------------

the folder structure is as below. We assume a Linux system is available to run
the code, with R installed, reasonable parallel capabilities, a GCC compiler to
build Rcpp extensions and necessary packages (optparse, jpeg, Rcpp, RcppArmadillo).

Running Q5
----------

For Q5, the first hypothesis test, run calc.R using Rscript as follows:

Rscript calc.R -i 10 -n 100

where i refers to the image index (1-30), and n refers to the number of bootstrap samples.

For Q5, the second hypothesis test, run calc2.R using Rscript as follows:

Rscript calc2.R -i 10 -n 100

note calc2.R relies on the files output by calc.R

finally, view the output table as in the PDF using post.R


Running Q6
----------

For Q6, to use the simulated data from a normal distribution run calc.R using Rscript as follows:

Rscript calc.R -k 20 -n 100

where k refers to the number of singular values to use, and n refers to the number of bootstrap samples.

For Q6, to use the simulated data as a bootstrap from Z run calc2.R using Rscript as follows:

Rscript calc2.R -k 20 -n 100

finally, view the output table as in the PDF using post.R
